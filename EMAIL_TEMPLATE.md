**Subject:** Fitch Fork - Continued Development and NuGet Publication

---

Hi Luis,

I hope this message finds you well!

I'm reaching out regarding the **Fitch** project that you and Luis Angel Mendez Gortz created a few years ago. I've been maintaining a fork of Fitch and wanted to let you know about some significant developments.

## Background

I started working with Fitch around 2024 when I helped port it to Windows. Since then, the original repository has been inactive, but I've continued developing and improving the tool because I found it incredibly useful and well-designed.

## What I've Built On Top of Your Work

The fork now includes:
- **PNG logo support** (replacing ASCII art for better rendering)
- **GPU detection** for Windows, Linux, and WSL
- **Battery information** display
- **Terminal emulator detection**
- **Distribution-specific RGB color schemes**
- **Enhanced configuration system** with DistroName mode (honoring the original design)
- **Improved Setup.sh** with dependency checking
- All code comments translated to English for broader contribution

## My Intention

I'm planning to:
1. **Publish the fork to my personal GitHub** (with full credit to you and Luis Angel)
2. **Publish to NuGet** as an actively maintained package
3. **Continue maintaining and improving the tool**

## Credit & Attribution

I want to be completely transparent and respectful of your original work:

- The README clearly states this is a fork of your original project
- Full credit given to you and Luis Angel as the original authors
- The LICENSE file maintains your copyright alongside mine
- An AUTHORS.txt file documents the project history
- The DistroName mode specifically honors your original vision

You can see the fork here: [Your GitHub URL when ready]

## Questions for You

1. Are you comfortable with me maintaining this as an active fork?
2. Would you prefer any changes to how credit is given?
3. Is there anything specific you'd like mentioned or preserved?

I completely understand if you have any concerns or suggestions. My goal is to continue the great work you started while being fully transparent and respectful.

Thank you for creating Fitch in the first place - it's a great tool and the F# implementation is excellent!

Best regards,
[Your Name]

**Optional P.S.:** If you're interested, I'd be happy to give you co-maintainer access to the fork, or we could discuss other collaboration models. No pressure at all - I'm also perfectly happy to maintain it independently with full attribution.
